# Update:

This project hasn't been maintained for about a year, and I don't plan on changing that, so I'll archive the repository.

Description:
--------------
This is a plugin for [HunterPie](https://github.com/Haato3o/HunterPie) that synchronizes Part and Ailment data between clients.

The server is open source and available [here](https://hub.docker.com/r/todry542/mhwsync).<br>
It is currently deployed on my own server. Please by nice with ;)

Please note that this plugin has not undergone extensive testing yet as I can't test it properly without the help of other players.

Installation:
---------------
Download [module.json](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Todry542/HunterPie-SyncPlugin/master/module.json) and drag the file into you HunterPie application window.
